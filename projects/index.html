        <h2> Nitrogen and Sulfur Cycling on the Early Earth</h2>
			<p>As part of the <a href="https://apps.carleton.edu/people/randerson/" target="blank">Anderson lab group</a> at Carleton College, I have worked on various projects that use publicly availible genomes to learn about microbes on the early earth. We recently wrapped up a project where we examined the history of various genes required for nitrogen cycling using bioinformatic methods (<a href = "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.064543v1">preprint here</a>). We also plan to investigate sulfur cycling genes to determine when certain metabolisms were particularly adventageous in the history of the early Earth. The findings of these studies may have implications to find extraterrestrial life, and this work is done in cooperation with the <a href= "https://depts.washington.edu/naivpl/content/welcome-virtual-planetary-laboratory" target="blank">Virtual Planetary Lab </a> at UW. </p>
			<h2> Sulfur Biogeochemical Cycling by <i>Shewanella</i> BF02</h2>
			<!--<img src="/assets/Shewlab.JPG" align=”right” width="200"/>-->
			<p> I was part of the <a href="http://reu.cofc.edu/" target="blank">Fort Johnson REU</a> program at the College of Charleston during the summer of 2019. I worked with Dr. Peter Lee at the Hollings Marine Laboratory, focusing on a strain of <i>Shewanella</i> isolated from the outflow of Blood Falls, Antarctica. I was broadly interested in the potential roles of <i>Shewanella</i> in the sulfur cylce. I found evidence that <i>Shewanella</i> is able to produce dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a volatile organic sulfur compound important in global temperature regulation and that <i>Shewanella</i> preferentially coupled specific sulfur sources with iron redox cycling. </p>
        <h2> Thorium Isotope Analysis Optimization</h2>
	<p> During my Study Abroad in Australia, I completed my Independent Study Project (ISP) at the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) at the University of Tasmania (UTAS), under the guidance of Prof. Zanna Chase and Dr. Axel Durand. I spent around a month in the sediment lab, attempting to uncover why thorium and uranium yields from sediment were so low, according to ICP-MS analysis. Despite our valient attempts, I was unable to find any pretreatment that appreciably improved the yields.
