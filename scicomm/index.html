			<h2>What's Cooking</h2>
			<p> As part of my involvement with <a href="http://www.cambridgecamping.org/sebcamps" target="blank"> Daybreak Day Camp</a>, I helped develop the What's Cooking program, a virtual STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math)cooking program for middle school students. The program was three days during school vacation week, run over Zoom with students in their own families' kitchens. Drawing inspiration from the Young Chef's program at Carleton College, I some science/cooking lessons including yeast/baking bread, acid-base chemistry/making pickles, and the scientific method/designing cookie recipes. The program was a result of a collaboration with Cambridge Camping, Lesley University, and financial support from Biogen. </p> 
		
			<h2>Fort Johnson REUn</h2>
			<p> As part of my Fort Johnson REU experience, we learned about science communitcation and had some opportunities to practice our new skills. Here are a few of the science communication products that I was involved with:
			<ul>
				<li> I was featured on the <a href="https://www.lastchanceendeavors.com/podcast/episode/2e3514af/reu-mini-series-episode-02-or-jackson-eberwein-jules-duran-and-katherine-mateos-or-a-whole-bag-of-issues" target="blank"> Conservation Connection podcast</a> with Last Chance Endeavors. </li>
				<li> I wrote a series of <a href="https://blogreu.wordpress.com/author/katherinemateos/" target="blank">blog posts</a> designed for non-expert audiences. </li>
				<li> I produced a short video designed for younger audiences about what my research was and why it matters. </li>
